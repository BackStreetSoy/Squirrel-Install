# Squirrel-Install

Steps:

1. Clone the Repo

2. In terminal run the following command:
```bash
./squirrel_setup
```

If it worked you'll see this error message:
```
fatal: Unable to read current working directory: No such file or directory
```

The Script is set to clean up after itself when it's done, so no need to worry about leaving a trail. Happy Squirreling!
